* [Shit HN Says](https://twitter.com/shit_hn_says/status/995790903099846656) The problem with complex type systems is that they force you to spend a lot of your development time thinking about type structures and their relationships
* [Spark Accumulator](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/rdd-programming-guide.html#accumulators) Accumulators are variables that are only “added” to through an associative and commutative operation and can therefore be efficiently supported in parallel. They can be used to implement counters (as in MapReduce) or sums.
